## Quick Start

1. Install Truffle: `npm install -g truffle` - [Docs](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/quickstart)
2. Clone repo and run `npm install`
3. Create an `app.env` file to store private variables (see `truffle-config.js` file). This is only necessary for development to a live testnet such as Goerli or Ropsten.
4. You will need to connect to a blockchain and Truffle provides different options, such as [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart).
5. Run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests. Truffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands  above. You can interact with the contracts with `truffle console`.

## About

Ultimately these contracts will be incorporated into a decentralized application currently being developed in a [separate repo](https://github.com/fuguefoundation/ff-dapp).
