### Install

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

### Quick Usage

From there, you can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

Truffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands  above. If you'd like to [configure a more advanced development environment](https://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration) we recommend you install the blockchain server separately by running `npm install -g ganache-cli` at the command line.

+  [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli): a command-line version of Truffle's blockchain server.
+  [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache/): A GUI for the server that displays your transaction history and chain state.
